One of them being a volunteer at a petting zoo, it was a really fun job i did back when i was really young\n it helped me learn the basics of being an employee and i got to work with really sweet animals!\n\nAfter the petting zoo i got a job at a supermarket, that being Dekamarkt Blokker. I have worked there for almost 4 years and managed to build a great bond with some really friendly co-workers!"
